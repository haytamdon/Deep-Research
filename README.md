# 🧠 DeepResearch

**DeepResearch** is an intelligent research automation workflow that combines AI-driven reasoning, web data search, and summarization pipelines to perform deep, multi-step research tasks.  
It’s designed to take complex questions, decompose them into sub-queries, and synthesize results into coherent, well-reasoned insights and generate a final report that answers the user questions.
